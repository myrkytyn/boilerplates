# Maks' BOILERPLATES

## Introduction
For me, engineering is like art. Sometimes, I need to get creative and come up with elegant solutions from scratch. I love those moments.
But sometimes, I just need to get things done. Not everything needs to be reinvented (or rewritten in Rust). 

I deal with a lot of Dockerfiles, configs, and other setups where proven best practices already exist. I found myself constantly Googling or digging through old projects to find working solutions. So I created this repo as my personal collection of production-ready templates. It is my toolbox of reliable code snippets that actually work in production.

## What is a boilerplate?
Boilerplate code, or simply boilerplate, refers to sections of code that get repeated across different projects with little to no change.
